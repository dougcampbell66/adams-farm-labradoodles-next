            Adams Farm&apos;s breeding dogs don&apos;t live in a kennel. They live
            as members of a family — in loving homes, with people who care for them
            every day, while remaining part of our breeding program.

          <p className="text-[1.05rem] text-charcoal leading-[1.75]">
            This is what makes the guardian model different: our dogs get to be
            dogs. They&apos;re loved, socialized, and part of daily life, not
            confined to a breeding facility. In return, guardian families give our
            program something a kennel never could — a dog raised the same way your
            puppy will be.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[1.05rem] text-charcoal leading-[1.75]">
            Puppies are whelped in the Campbell home, where Douglas and Erika
            oversee everything from birth through early development. But the sires
            and dams themselves — the dogs who make each litter possible — live
            their lives in the homes of families who love them.

            It&apos;s a simple idea: dogs raised in love make better companions.
            That&apos;s true for our breeding dogs, and it&apos;s true for the
            puppies they bring into the world.
